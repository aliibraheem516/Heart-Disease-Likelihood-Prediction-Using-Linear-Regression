# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict heart disease based on a medical dataset. The dataset includes various health metrics and personal information of patients. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions with an example input.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `heart.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `age`: Age of the patient.
- `sex`: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female).
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0-3).
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2).
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2).
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-4) colored by fluoroscopy.
- `thal`: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect).
- `target`: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Files

- `heart.csv`: The dataset containing medical information and diagnostic measurements.
- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.
